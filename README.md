# Relay-Switch-for-Launch-Controller
This relay switch daughterboard is a redesigned version of an older component from a rocket launch controller circuit. The updated design is now detachable and features LED displays to indicate the reception of a high input signal and a 5V signal. To optimize space and reduce manufacturing costs, components are mounted on both the front and back of the board.
